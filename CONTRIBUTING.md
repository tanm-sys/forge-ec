## Current Development Status

Forge EC has reached a major development milestone with all core cryptographic functionality implemented and tested! **All 26 tests are now passing** and **critical compiler warnings have been eliminated**. The library is ready for evaluation and further development.

### Recent Achievements

1. **All tests passing**: 26/26 tests now pass successfully across all curve implementations
2. **Complete core implementations**: All major cryptographic operations are fully implemented
3. **Zero critical warnings**: All manual assign operations and unused imports have been fixed
4. **Comprehensive curve support**: secp256k1, P-256, Curve25519, and Ed25519 are fully functional

### Current Priorities

1. **Signature schemes**: Implement ECDSA, EdDSA, and Schnorr signature algorithms
2. **Hash-to-curve**: Complete RFC9380 compliance for hash-to-curve operations
3. **Performance optimizations**: Add SIMD acceleration and other performance improvements
4. **Advanced features**: Implement batch verification and multi-signature schemes
5. **Documentation expansion**: Improve API documentation and add more examples
6. **Security audit preparation**: Prepare codebase for professional security audit

8. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
9. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature-name`
10. Open a Pull Request

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow Rust style guidelines
- Use `rustfmt` and `clippy`
- Write clear commit messages
- Document all public items
- Add tests for new functionality

### Safety Requirements

- No unsafe code in public API
- All cryptographic operations must be constant-time
- Clear secrets on drop using `zeroize`
- Use `subtle` crate for constant-time operations

### Testing

- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Add integration tests for new features
- Include test vectors from standards where applicable
- Test both success and failure cases
- Test with and without standard library

### Documentation

- Document all public items
- Include examples in documentation
- Explain security considerations
- Reference relevant standards/papers
- Keep README.md up to date

### Performance

- Benchmark critical operations
- Profile with different optimization levels
- Test on different architectures
- Consider SIMD optimizations

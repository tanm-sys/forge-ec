# CI Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to optimize the GitHub Actions workflows for the forge-ec repository.

## Changes Made

### Removed Workflows
- **ethicalcheck.yml** - API security testing not applicable to Rust libraries
- **rust-clippy.yml** - Duplicate Clippy analysis (consolidated into main CI)
- **greetings.yml** - Non-essential welcome messages
- **summary.yml** - Non-essential AI issue summarization

### Optimized Main CI (ci.yml)
**Before:** 8 jobs with extensive testing matrix
**After:** 4 essential jobs

#### Kept (Essential):
- **Tests** - Reduced from 4 Rust versions to 2 (stable + MSRV 1.70.0)
- **Clippy** - Linting for code quality
- **Rustfmt** - Code formatting checks
- **Docs** - Documentation validation

#### Moved to Extended Checks:
- **Miri tests** - Memory safety (now weekly/manual)
- **Code coverage** - Coverage reporting (now weekly/manual)
- **Minimal versions** - Dependency testing (now weekly/manual)
- **no_std compatibility** - Embedded target testing (now weekly/manual)
- **Beta/Nightly tests** - Future Rust version testing (now weekly/manual)

### New Workflows

#### extended-checks.yml
- Runs weekly on Sundays or manually
- Contains all the heavy/optional checks
- Allows thorough testing without blocking development

#### security.yml
- Replaces EthicalCheck with Rust-appropriate security checks
- Runs `cargo audit` for dependency vulnerabilities
- Runs security-focused Clippy lints
- Runs on push/PR and weekly

## Benefits

1. **Faster CI** - Reduced from ~8 jobs to 4 essential jobs
2. **Fewer failures** - Removed problematic EthicalCheck workflow
3. **Better organization** - Separated essential vs. optional checks
4. **Maintained quality** - All important checks still run, just reorganized
5. **Appropriate security** - Rust-specific security checks instead of API testing

## Workflow Triggers

- **CI (ci.yml)** - Every push/PR to main
- **Security (security.yml)** - Every push/PR to main + weekly
- **Extended Checks (extended-checks.yml)** - Weekly + manual trigger

## Recommendations

1. Consider enabling branch protection rules for main branch requiring:
   - CI workflow to pass
   - Security workflow to pass
   - Up-to-date branches

2. Run Extended Checks manually before major releases

3. Monitor security workflow for any dependency vulnerabilities

## Status

âœ… **Optimization Complete** - All workflows have been successfully optimized and deployed.

```

## Quick Start

### ECDSA with secp256k1

```rust
use forge_ec_core::{Curve, SignatureScheme};
use forge_ec_curves::secp256k1::Secp256k1;
use forge_ec_signature::ecdsa::Ecdsa;
use forge_ec_rng::os_rng::OsRng;
use sha2::Sha256;

// Generate a key pair
let mut rng = OsRng::new();
let secret_key = Secp256k1::Scalar::random(&mut rng);
let public_key = Secp256k1::multiply(&Secp256k1::generator(), &secret_key);
let public_key_affine = Secp256k1::to_affine(&public_key);

// Sign a message
let message = b"Hello, Cryptography!";
let signature = Ecdsa::<Secp256k1, Sha256>::sign(&secret_key, message);

// Verify the signature
let valid = Ecdsa::<Secp256k1, Sha256>::verify(&public_key_affine, message, &signature);
assert!(valid);
```

### EdDSA with Ed25519

```rust
use forge_ec_core::{Curve, SignatureScheme};
use forge_ec_curves::ed25519::Ed25519;
use forge_ec_signature::eddsa::{EdDsa, Ed25519Signature};
use forge_ec_rng::os_rng::OsRng;
use sha2::Sha512;

// Generate a key pair
let mut rng = OsRng::new();
let secret_key = Ed25519::Scalar::random(&mut rng);
let public_key = Ed25519::multiply(&Ed25519::generator(), &secret_key);
let public_key_affine = Ed25519::to_affine(&public_key);

// Sign a message
let message = b"Hello, Cryptography!";
let signature = EdDsa::<Ed25519, Sha512>::sign(&secret_key, message);

// Verify the signature
let valid = EdDsa::<Ed25519, Sha512>::verify(&public_key_affine, message, &signature);
assert!(valid);

// Alternatively, use the specialized Ed25519 implementation
let private_key_bytes = [0u8; 32]; // Replace with your private key
let public_key_bytes = Ed25519Signature::derive_public_key(&private_key_bytes);
let signature_bytes = Ed25519Signature::sign(&private_key_bytes, message);
let valid = Ed25519Signature::verify(&public_key_bytes, message, &signature_bytes);
```

### ECDH Key Exchange

```rust
use forge_ec_core::Curve;
use forge_ec_curves::secp256k1::Secp256k1;
use forge_ec_rng::os_rng::OsRng;
use sha2::{Digest, Sha256};

// Alice generates her key pair
let mut rng = OsRng::new();
let alice_sk = Secp256k1::Scalar::random(&mut rng);
let alice_pk = Secp256k1::multiply(&Secp256k1::generator(), &alice_sk);
let alice_pk_affine = Secp256k1::to_affine(&alice_pk);

// Bob generates his key pair
let bob_sk = Secp256k1::Scalar::random(&mut rng);
let bob_pk = Secp256k1::multiply(&Secp256k1::generator(), &bob_sk);
let bob_pk_affine = Secp256k1::to_affine(&bob_pk);

// Alice computes the shared secret
let alice_shared_point = Secp256k1::multiply(&Secp256k1::from_affine(&bob_pk_affine), &alice_sk);
let alice_shared_point_affine = Secp256k1::to_affine(&alice_shared_point);
let alice_shared_secret = alice_shared_point_affine.x().to_bytes();

// Bob computes the shared secret
let bob_shared_point = Secp256k1::multiply(&Secp256k1::from_affine(&alice_pk_affine), &bob_sk);
let bob_shared_point_affine = Secp256k1::to_affine(&bob_shared_point);
let bob_shared_secret = bob_shared_point_affine.x().to_bytes();

// The shared secrets should be identical
assert_eq!(alice_shared_secret, bob_shared_secret);

// Derive a symmetric key using a KDF
let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
hasher.update(&alice_shared_secret);
let symmetric_key = hasher.finalize();
```

## Architecture

The library is split into multiple crates for modularity:

- `forge-ec-core`: Core traits and abstractions
- `forge-ec-curves`: Specific curve implementations
- `forge-ec-signature`: Signature scheme implementations
- `forge-ec-encoding`: Serialization formats
- `forge-ec-hash`: Cryptographic hash functions

These improvements ensure that the hash-to-curve operations are secure against timing attacks and follow the RFC9380 specification more closely.

### Ed25519 Implementation

We've recently implemented several key components for the Ed25519 curve:

#### Field Element Operations
- Field reduction with proper modulo p = 2^255 - 19
- Constant-time arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, negation)

### Key Differences

- **RustCrypto**: Forge EC provides a more cohesive API across different curves and algorithms, while RustCrypto consists of many smaller crates with varying interfaces.
- **Dalek**: Forge EC supports more curves (including secp256k1 and P-256) and signature schemes (ECDSA, Schnorr), while Dalek focuses primarily on Curve25519/Ed25519.
- **ring**: Forge EC is pure Rust with no unsafe code in the public API, while ring uses C and assembly code for performance. Forge EC also supports more curves and signature schemes.

## Security Features

### Constant-Time Operations

All cryptographically sensitive operations are implemented to run in constant time to prevent timing attacks:

- Field arithmetic operations use the `subtle` crate for constant-time conditional selection
- Scalar multiplication uses constant-time algorithms (Montgomery ladder, double-and-add-always)
- Point validation and equality checks are constant-time
- No secret-dependent branches or memory accesses

### Memory Protection

- Automatic secret clearing via `zeroize` to prevent secret leakage after use
- All secret material (private keys, nonces) is zeroized when dropped
- No heap allocations for sensitive data where possible
- Proper handling of sensitive data in error cases

### Error Handling

- No panics in core cryptographic operations
- All operations return `Result` or `CtOption` types
- Proper validation of all inputs to prevent invalid curve attacks
- Clear error messages that don't leak sensitive information

### Testing and Verification

- Comprehensive test vectors from standards (NIST, RFC, etc.)
- Property-based testing with proptest
- Fuzzing integration with cargo-fuzz
- Memory safety verification with Miri
- Constant-time verification with dudect/ctgrind

### Standards Compliance

- RFC6979 for deterministic ECDSA nonce generation
- RFC8032 for Ed25519 implementation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Failures

**Issue**: Some tests are failing, particularly in the curve implementations.

**Solution**: This is expected in the current development state. We've implemented temporary workarounds for some tests, but others are still failing. These will be fixed in future updates. If you need to use the library in its current state, you can:

1. Disable the failing tests by using `#[ignore]` attributes
2. Use only the functionality that has been fully implemented and tested
3. Contribute fixes for the failing tests (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md))

#### Build Failures

**Issue**: Compilation errors related to missing features.

**Solution**: Ensure you're using Rust 1.70.0 or later and check that you've enabled the necessary features in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
forge-ec = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["std"] }
```

#### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Cryptographic operations are slower than expected.

**Solution**: Enable the appropriate feature flags for your target architecture:

```toml
forge-ec = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["std", "simd"] }
```

#### Compatibility with Other Libraries

**Issue**: Interoperability issues with other cryptographic libraries.

**Solution**: Use the encoding/decoding functions in `forge-ec-encoding` to convert between formats:

```rust
// Convert from forge-ec to raw bytes
let forge_ec_signature = Ecdsa::<Secp256k1, Sha256>::sign(&secret_key, message);
let der_signature = EcdsaSignature::from_signature::<Secp256k1>(&forge_ec_signature).to_der();

// Convert from raw bytes to forge-ec
let forge_ec_signature = EcdsaSignature::from_der(&der_signature)
    .unwrap()
    .to_signature::<Secp256k1>();
```

#### no_std Environment Issues

**Issue**: Compilation errors in `no_std` environments.

**Solution**: Disable the `std` feature and enable the `alloc` feature:

```toml
forge-ec = { version = "0.1.0", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }
```
